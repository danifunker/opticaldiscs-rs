## 0.4.3 — 2026-05-20

### Fixed

- **Multi-FILE BIN/CUE TOC offsets are now absolute disc positions.**
  `build_bincue_toc()` previously used each track's local `file_byte_offset`
  (the per-file `INDEX 01` pregap) as the disc offset, which is correct for
  single-BIN CUEs but produced non-monotonic offsets — and a lead-out that only
  reflected the last BIN — for multi-FILE CUEs (one `.bin` per track, common in
  redump-style dumps). The resulting `DiscTOC::to_toc_string()` /
  `musicbrainz_id()` values were rejected by MusicBrainz with `400 Bad Request —
  "Invalid TOC"`.

  The builder now accumulates a running frame total across BIN files so each
  track's offset is `running_frames + local_index_01_frames`, and the lead-out
  is the summed sector count of every BIN. Single-BIN CUEs (where every track
  shares one file) keep identical output.

  Downstream consumers (e.g. `ODE-artwork-downloader`) should bump their
  `opticaldiscs` dependency to `0.4.3` to fix MusicBrainz lookups on per-track
  BIN dumps.
